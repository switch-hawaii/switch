This branch is a pre-release version of Switch 2.0.6 that was used for the
Hawaii price response study. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation
instructions. See https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7228323 and
https://github.com/switch-hawaii/price_response for more details on the price
response study and advice on how to replicate the results.

This version of Switch should not be used for new work, but is archived here for
use in replicating the Switch-Hawaii price response study. See
https://switch-model.org for instructions on installing and using Switch for new
work.
